## Overview

This project focuses on improving document retrieval efficiency in industrial manufacturing using generative AI. Traditional methods lead to unplanned downtime during daily operations. The proposed solution leverages generative AI's natural language processing capabilities to provide swift and personalized search results, reducing downtime by enabling context-aware querying. The solution streamlines post-sales service workforce training through generative AI, facilitating rapid issue diagnosis and minimizing equipment downtime, thereby fostering trust.

## Problem Statement

Document retrieval is a significant impediment in industrial manufacturing, especially during new employee onboarding and routine operations when workers urgently require manuals, diagrams, and instructions. The vast documentation from numerous machinery suppliers makes searching via manual lookups or keywords time-consuming and inefficient. This leads to unplanned downtime and production delays as workers struggle to access the information needed to troubleshoot issues and operate equipment properly.

## Solution Overview

The proposed solution incorporates a comprehensive language model (LLM) and the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model. The system features a prompt interface, allowing technicians or service workers to input their machine operation concerns. The output includes detailed, step-by-step instructions to address and resolve the identified issues or problems.

The model generates responses based on the provided prompts, drawing upon its training data consisting of machinery manuals. The responses are tailored to match the input prompt, ensuring relevance and coherence in the provided outcomes.

## Architecture

1. **Formatting Responses**: The model streamlines user inputs for optimal processing.
2. **Prompts and Queries**: Users articulate their queries or prompts in a user-friendly manner.
4. **LLM (Generative Approach Interface)**: The LLM plays a central role in generating contextually relevant and coherent responses.
5. **Vector Database Storage**: Efficient storage and retrieval of vectors.
6. **Vector Search**: Enables the model to sift through embedded and formatted queries, delivering precise and contextually relevant results.



## Expected Outcome

The system will feature a prompt interface, allowing technicians or service workers to input their machine operation concerns. The output will include detailed, step-by-step instructions to address and resolve the identified issues or problems.

## Relevance to Business Analytics

- Manufacturers can tightly customize the system to their specific knowledge base and terminology by developing an in-house solution for contextual document retrieval using generative AI.
- As documentation evolves, the generative model can be continuously trained with an internally built web app, keeping the AI's domain expertise aligned with the manufacturer's needs.
- Streamlining document retrieval with the generative AI web app enhances data input for analytics, empowering workers to provide higher-quality inputs.
- An in-house solution offers early access to AI advances, providing a competitive edge.
- This approach underscores the strategic value of internal AI expertise for industrial enterprises.
